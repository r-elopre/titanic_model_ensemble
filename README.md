## Project Overview

This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically feature engineering and model stacking. The goal is to enhance predictive performance by creating meaningful features from the dataset and combining the strengths of multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) into a stacking ensemble. The project fulfills the requirements of the "Improve Titanic Predictions with Smart Features + Model Blending" activity, producing a feature-engineered dataset, individual model evaluations, an ensemble model, and comprehensive performance metrics.

## Dataset Description

### Input Data
- **File**: `data/train_scaled.csv`
- **Source**: Preprocessed Titanic dataset, assumed to be derived from the Kaggle Titanic dataset.
- **Columns** (18 total):
  - **Target**: `Survived` (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)
  - **Identifier**: `PassengerId`
  - **Features**:
    - Numerical: `Pclass`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`
    - Categorical (encoded as binary): `Sex_male`, `Embarked_q`, `Embarked_s`, `Deck_B`, `Deck_C`, `Deck_D`, `Deck_E`, `Deck_F`, `Deck_G`, `Deck_T`, `Deck_Unknown`
- **Shape**: 891 rows, 18 columns (before feature engineering)
- **Note**: The `Name` column, typically used for extracting titles (e.g., Mr, Mrs), was not available, so alternative features were created.

### Feature Engineering
Three new features were engineered to capture additional patterns in the data:
1. **FamilySize**: Sum of `SibSp` (siblings/spouses aboard), `Parch` (parents/children aboard), and 1 (the passenger themselves). This represents the total family size onboard.
   - Formula: `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1`
2. **IsAlone**: Binary indicator of whether the passenger is traveling alone (1 if `FamilySize == 1`, else 0).
   - Rationale: Passengers traveling alone may have different survival probabilities due to social or logistical factors.
3. **FarePerPerson**: Fare divided by `FamilySize`, representing the per-person cost of the ticket.
   - Formula: `FarePerPerson = Fare / FamilySize`
   - Rationale: Accounts for shared tickets among families, potentially correlating with socioeconomic status.

- **Output**: The engineered dataset (891 rows, 19 columns, including the 3 new features) is saved as `data/train_engineered.csv`.
- **Impact**: These features enhance the models' ability to capture relationships between family dynamics, socioeconomic factors, and survival outcomes.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- **Loading**: The dataset is loaded from `C:\Users\ri\OneDrive\ai project\model\Titanic Smart Features Model Blending\data\train_scaled.csv`.
- **Train-Test Split**: 80/20 split (712 training samples, 179 test samples) with `random_state=42` for reproducibility.
- **Features**: All columns except `PassengerId` and `Survived` are used as features (16 original + 3 engineered = 19 features).
- **Target**: `Survived` (binary classification: 0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).

### Models
Four models were trained and evaluated:
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Parameters: `max_iter=1000`, `random_state=42`
   - Description: A linear model serving as a baseline, effective for binary classification with interpretable coefficients.
2. **Random Forest**:
   - Parameters: Default settings, `random_state=42`
   - Description: An ensemble of decision trees, robust to overfitting and capable of capturing non-linear relationships.
3. **XGBoost**:
   - Parameters: `eval_metric='logloss'`, `random_state=42`
   - Description: A gradient boosting model, optimized for performance and handling complex feature interactions.
4. **Stacking Ensemble**:
   - Configuration: `StackingClassifier` combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with Logistic Regression as the final estimator.
   - Description: Combines predictions from the three base models to leverage their complementary strengths, potentially improving overall performance.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, F1-score for each class (`Not Survived`, `Survived`), plus macro and weighted averages.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized using a heatmap to show true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Comparison**: The ensemble's accuracy is compared to individual models to assess improvement.

### Outputs
- **Engineered Dataset**: `data/train_engineered.csv`
- **Predictions**: `data/ensemble_predictions.csv` (contains `PassengerId` and predicted `Survived` for the test set)
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrix for the ensemble saved as `images/confusion_matrix_ensemble.png`
- **Console Output**: Accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices for all models.

## Reproducibility Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: Install via `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib`
- Dataset: Ensure `train_scaled.csv` is in `C:\Users\ri\OneDrive\ai project\model\Titanic Smart Features Model Blending\data`

### Steps to Run
1. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib
   ```
2. **Place Input Data**: Ensure `train_scaled.csv` is in the `data` directory.
3. **Run Script**:
   ```bash
   python titanic_model_ensemble.py
   ```
4. **Expected Outputs**:
   - Console: Accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and model comparison.
   - Files: `train_engineered.csv`, `ensemble_predictions.csv` in `data/`, and `confusion_matrix_ensemble.png` in `images/`.

### Notes
- The script assumes `train_scaled.csv` has the same structure as described (18 columns, including `PassengerId`, `Survived`, and 16 features).
- If the `Name` column were available, a `Title` feature could be extracted using regex (e.g., `df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\.')`), potentially improving performance.
- The stacking ensembleâ€™s performance depends on the diversity of base models; further tuning (e.g., hyperparameter optimization) could enhance results.

## Analysis and Insights

- **Feature Engineering Impact**: The addition of `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, and `FarePerPerson` likely improved model performance by capturing social and economic factors. For example, `IsAlone` may correlate with survival due to differences in evacuation behavior, and `FarePerPerson` adjusts for shared tickets, refining the socioeconomic signal of `Fare`.
- **Model Strengths**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Reliable baseline, excels in linearly separable data.
  - **Random Forest**: Captures non-linear patterns but had the lowest accuracy (0.8101), possibly due to overfitting or default parameters.
  - **XGBoost**: Strong performance (0.8268) due to gradient boosting, handling feature interactions well.
  - **Stacking Ensemble**: Best performer (0.8324), leveraging complementary strengths, particularly improving recall for `Not Survived` (0.89).
- **Ensemble Advantage**: The stacking ensembleâ€™s slight accuracy improvement (0.8324 vs. 0.8268 for XGBoost) suggests it effectively combines model predictions, reducing errors (fewer false positives than Random Forest, fewer false negatives than Logistic Regression).
- **Limitations**:
  - Lack of `Name` column prevented `Title` extraction, which could have added predictive power (e.g., distinguishing officers or nobility).
  - Default parameters were used for Random Forest and XGBoost; hyperparameter tuning (as in your `titanic_model_xgboost_tuned.py`) could further improve results.
  - The datasetâ€™s small size (891 samples) limits model complexity; larger datasets might benefit more from ensemble methods.

## Future Improvements
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV for Random Forest and XGBoost to optimize parameters (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`).
2. **Additional Features**: If raw data with `Name` or `Ticket` is available, extract `Title` or ticket-based features (e.g., ticket group size).
3. **Alternative Ensembles**: Experiment with VotingClassifier (soft or hard voting) or blending instead of stacking.
4. **Feature Importance**: Analyze feature importance (e.g., using XGBoostâ€™s `feature_importances_`) to identify key predictors.
5. **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust performance estimates.

## Conclusion

This project successfully implemented feature engineering and model stacking to predict Titanic survival, achieving a test accuracy of 0.8324 with the stacking ensemble, outperforming individual models (Logistic Regression: 0.8212, Random Forest: 0.8101, XGBoost: 0.8268). The engineered features (`FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, `FarePerPerson`) enhanced the modelsâ€™ ability to capture meaningful patterns, and the stacking ensemble effectively combined model strengths. All required outputs were generated, and the project is fully reproducible with the provided script and instructions.
